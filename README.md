Track issues from a code repository, and show them on your WordPress site.


## Description 
This plugin makes it possible to show a list of issues from [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
on a WordPress page. It has a flexible filtering system so you can specify 
which issues from which projects that should be taken into account. 

This plugin can also make data available for other services to use, at this time
[Dasheroo](http://www.dasheroo.com/) is supported.

You can use this plugin on an intranet or extranet, to show the status of a team
or project You can use it to show KPI:s such as how many issues that were closed
last week, plot a graph over the current number of open issues in the current sprint
(a sprint burndown chart), or show all the issues with a "help-wanted" label in
order to engage with the open source community.

Here are a few examples of things you can do:


### Sprint Burn Down Chart

  README.md file using `make readme`.
